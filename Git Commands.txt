Git Commands

I will be updating this file with new git commands.

[git init] initialises a local repository
[git remote -v ] lets you see the url to push to and fetch from
[git ls-files] lets you see files added to your local repository
[git status] lets you check status
[git add .] lets you add files in the current directory to staging area
[git commit -m "name of commit"] commits what is on the staged area to "name of commit"
[git checkout -b caleb] creates a branch on your local repository and cd's into it
[git pull origin caleb] replace the local branch(caleb) repository-branch with whatever files that is on your remote repository-branch
[git push origin caleb] pushes files from local repository-branch to remote repository-branch
